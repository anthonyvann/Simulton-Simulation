# A Black_Hole is derived from a Simulton base; it updates by finding+removing
#   any objects (derived from a Prey base) whose center is crosses inside its
#   radius (and returns a set of all eaten simultons); it displays as a black
#   circle with a radius of 10 (e.g., a width/height 20).
# Calling get_dimension for the width/height (for containment and displaying)'
#   will facilitate inheritance in Pulsator and Hunter
